# DeepUbuntuAV

## Overview

DeepUbuntuAV is a comprehensive data collection, cleaning, and labeling platform specifically designed for autonomous vehicle development in challenging real-world conditions. Unlike traditional AV datasets that focus primarily on well-maintained roads in developed regions like the Bay Area, DeepUbuntuAV captures the harsh realities of driving in Africa and Asia—unpaved roads, extreme weather, complex traffic patterns, and infrastructure variations that current autonomous vehicle systems struggle to handle.

## The Challenge We Solve

Current autonomous vehicle datasets are heavily biased toward:
- **Smooth, well-maintained roads** with clear lane markings
- **Predictable traffic patterns** with rule-following drivers
- **Consistent infrastructure** and road signage
- **Optimal weather conditions** with good visibility

**Real-world driving conditions** in Africa and Asia present:
- Unpaved roads, potholes, and irregular surfaces
- Mixed traffic with pedestrians, livestock, and informal vendors
- Inconsistent or missing road infrastructure
- Extreme weather conditions affecting visibility and road conditions
- Cultural driving patterns and local traffic norms

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Data Collection
- **Multi-Modal Sensors**: High-resolution cameras, LiDAR, radar, and GPS
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Weather, lighting, and road condition sensors
- **Traffic Analysis**: Real-time detection and classification of vehicles, pedestrians, animals, and obstacles
- **Infrastructure Mapping**: 3D mapping of road surfaces, signage, and landmarks

### Advanced Labeling Pipeline
- **Pixel-Perfect Segmentation**: Precise object boundaries for complex scenarios
- **3D Bounding Boxes**: Full spatial understanding for dynamic objects
- **Semantic Mapping**: Road surface classification and drivability analysis
- **Behavioral Annotation**: Traffic pattern analysis and cultural driving norms

### Edge Computing Platform
- **Real-Time Processing**: On-device data filtering and initial labeling
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Intelligent data compression and prioritization
- **Offline Capability**: Continuous operation in areas with limited connectivity
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation and consistency checking
